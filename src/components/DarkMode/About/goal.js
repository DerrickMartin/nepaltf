    <h2>GOAL:</h2>
<p>
Our goal is to create a space where Nepali athletes, both in Nepal and those scattered globally, can connect, share their experiences, and learn from one another. 

We believe that by providing a space for athletes to share their stories,
 we can inspire the next generation of Nepali athletes to follow in their footsteps and achieve their dreams.
We are dedicated to providing the latest news, updates, and resources related to track and field in Nepal.
 From interviews with top athletes to training tips and techniques, our website is the ultimate resource for anyone interested in the sport.
